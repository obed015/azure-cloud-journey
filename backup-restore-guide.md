# Azure Backup & Restore Lab

## What I did:
- Created Recovery Services Vault
- Enabled backup for UbuntuVM
- Triggered a manual backup
- Deleted simulated VM (or tested on live one)
- Restored using "Create new VM" option

## Lessons:
- Backup = policy + retention
- Restore VM ≠ restore NSG/Networking → must be checked manually
