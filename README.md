# Azure Cloud Engineer Roadmap – Hands-On Journey 

Welcome to my 8-month hands-on learning journey toward becoming an Azure Cloud Engineer.  
This repository is filled with daily hands-on tasks, real-world labs, and structured learning I build along the way.



## Week 1: Azure VMs + Load Balancer + Backup

## What I built:
- Deployed Ubuntu & Windows VMs in different AZs
- Connected to Load Balancer with public IP & health probe
- Configured Azure Backup & simulated a full VM restore
- Mounted data disks, created file shares
- Troubleshot common failures using Serial Console, NSG, DNS, disk recovery

- 

## This repo shows:
- Real lab implementations, not just theory
- Quizzes, troubleshooting drills.



Stay tuned for new folders every week.
