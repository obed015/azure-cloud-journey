# Week 1 â€“ Azure VMs & High Availability Web App Deployment

This repository contains my hands-on labs, architecture, and notes for Week 1 of my 8-month Azure Cloud Engineer journey. I deployed VMs, configured HA with Load Balancer and Availability Zones, and built resilience with Azure Backup & troubleshooting.

## Highlights
- Ubuntu & Windows VMs deployed
- Azure Load Balancer (Standard SKU) with backend pool
- Availability Zones configuration
- Data disk management
- Backup and restore lab using Recovery Services Vault
- Serial Console rescue & NSG troubleshooting
