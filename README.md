# Azure Cloud Engineer Roadmap â€“ Hands-On Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my 8-month hands-on learning journey toward becoming an Azure Cloud Engineer.  
This repository tracks every major concept, lab, and real-world project I build along the way.



## âœ… Week 1: Azure VMs + Load Balancer + Backup

Folder: [`Week-1-VMs-HA-Setup`](./Week-1-VMs-HA-Setup)

## What I built:
- Deployed Ubuntu & Windows VMs in different AZs
- Connected to Load Balancer with public IP & health probe
- Configured Azure Backup & simulated a full VM restore
- Mounted data disks, created file shares
- Troubleshot common failures using Serial Console, NSG, DNS, disk recovery


- Architecture Diagram & Lab Notes included inside folder.


Stay tuned for new folders every week.
